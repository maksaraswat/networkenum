networkenum
===========

Using Scapy framework for enumerating network. networkenum.py is the main script that calls other scripts icmp_ping.py and arp_ping.py. As more features will be added, networkenum.py will be updated to call them. You can read more about the project at my blog http://blog.l3g3ndary.org.

Special thanks to Dan Melfi.
